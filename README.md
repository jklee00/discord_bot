# discord_bot
This repository contains a modified version of my old discord bot that now utilizes the Riot API, and any other files necessary for the bot to function.

The bot itself is written in Python and uses discord.py API and has several basic commands:
calc, computes a basic calculation entered in by a user and returns both the question and answer
join, shows when a user has joined the server the bot is in
lol, shows a League of Legends user and their ranks
ping, shows latency
rand, generates a random number from 0 to whatever is specified
help, there by default, provides more info on commands

Future updates would include:
Using youtube_dl to incorporate voice channel features
More extensive use of the Riot API
Adding a simple game (e.g. hangman, tic-tac-toe)
